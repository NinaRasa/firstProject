# firstProject
This is a first trial on the basics. Repository is public which means that anyone who has the URL access can view the files on the repo. You can choose to "Private" the project then it will be password'ed. 
This project addresses the problem of developing a systemized approach (in the form of an Expert System) to take decision on common data.
